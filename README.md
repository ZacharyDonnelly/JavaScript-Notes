# Notes

# Basic DOM

Use innerHTML for creating new elements.
Use insertAdjascentHTML for more secure.
Use textContent for inside text.

# Local Storage

Stores in brower until hard reload/localstorage.clear(). Can be used to store data that will persist through a soft refresh.
Syntax is similiar to objects with dot notation.
The read-only localStorage property allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions. localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed.

It should be noted that data stored in either localStorage or sessionStorage is specific to the protocol of the page.

The keys and the values are always strings (note that, as with objects, integer keys will be automatically converted to strings).

#.forEach()

The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.

EXAMPLE:
var array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

array1.forEach(function(element) {
  console.log(element);
});


# .map()

The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
Higher-Order function.

EAMPLE:
var array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];

// pass a function to map
const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);

console.log(map1);
// expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]

# .filter()

The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
Higher-Order function.

EXAMPLE:
var words = ['spray', 'limit', 'elite', 'exuberant', 'destruction', 'present'];

const result = words.filter(word => word.length > 6);

console.log(result);
// expected output: Array ["exuberant", "destruction", "present"]


# .reduce()

The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
Higher-Order function.
EXAMPLE:
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue;

// 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
console.log(array1.reduce(reducer));
// expected output: 10

# Array spreads ...

Use array spreads ... to copy arrays.

// bad
const len = items.length;
const itemsCopy = [];
let i;

for (i = 0; i < len; i += 1) {
  itemsCopy[i] = items[i];
}

// good
const itemsCopy = [...items];
